# Extra rooms repository
Add-on rooms for the locations with random generation for the game "Fallout: Equestria Remains".

Directory "[Integrated rooms](/IntegratedRooms)" contain united original rooms by DipFanken AND rooms created by other players, so you might just replace the same file in the "Rooms/*.xml" (do not forget about a backup of the original file!).


## General rules for adding rooms

**Do not post impenetrable and unfinished rooms.** Of course, bugfixes are allowed, but it's better to avoid global room reworking.

**Test** every new room **at least twice** before committing.

**Remove your template rooms** before uploading.

### Advices

Stick to the logical and rational idea of the room: playing chaotic labyrinth is not interesting.

Try not to create deadlocks.
  - e.g. falling down the deep pit which cannot be escaped without Kinetic dash or Teleportation spell.
  - It will be better if every significant subroom will have more than one entrance.
  - Note that all windows and lattices in game might be destroyed using heavy handy weapons or explosives. Same for much of the doors.
  - If this deadlock, despite all the warnings, is still part of the idea, drop the Rune of Return in it.

Note that map generator isn't ideal and may not understand you. In other words, be predictable for the generator (but not for the players :) ).

Imagine different styles of playing for your room, like sniping and telekinesis fight. Make sure high-level skills (e.g. master of telekinesis) will not break the gameplay dramatically.

Try not to create unreachable places: hoofshoes on the random maps may be generated almost anywhere.

Avoid lack of details as well as over-detailing.

Usually one-sided passages perceived negatively by players.

Do not put partial foreground tiles to the outer perimeter of the room.

Desired room name format: "`Nickname_level.name[_back]`"
  - Make the prefix of your (shortened) nickname before the level name.
  - Use dot (".") as a delimeter in the level name. It seems like FoE: Remains Editor don't like spaces in the room names and so may crash.
  - Use the "_back", "_b" or "_layer" suffix for the second layer of the room.
  - Do not put control characters.
